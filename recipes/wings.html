        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 2 lb.chicken wings </li>
                <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                <li>kosher salt</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 c. hot sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. honey</li>
                <li>4 tbsp. butter</li>
                <li>Ranch</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through. </li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, whisk together hot sauce and honey. Bring to simmer then stir in butter. Cook until butter is melted and slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Heat broiler on low. Transfer baked wings to a bowl and toss with buffalo sauce until completely coated. Return wings to rack and broil—watching carefully!—until sauce caramelizes, 3 minutes. Serve with ranch dressing and vegetables.</li>
